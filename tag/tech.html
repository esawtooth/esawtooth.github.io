</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I grew up as a programmer on vim. In my first week at college, I was
treated to an interesting discourse on the virtues of vim, emacs and
their ilk from Prof. Suban which first lead me to appreciate them
better. Vim is simple, and very quickly becomes a part of the
background. You forget that it exists, as you work through the code. Its
loaded with some amazing stuff that can really make you productive, yet
at the same time, it simply does not throw that at you all at once. You
can learn how to use it after following through the first few screens of
vimtutor, and that can be enough for all the editing you will ever
do. Just when you start getting frustrated with doing repetitive stuff
on the screen and start searching around for a smarter way, you will
quickly spot a promising command that will make very short work of the
problem. vim is awesome, and I spent close to six years using it as my
editor of choice.</p>
<p>A few months ago, reading though some of
<a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.in/">Steve Yegge</a>'s posts about emacs
convinced me to give emacs a try. This wasn't the first time I had fired
up emacs. I had been through its tutorial a time or two before and could
make my way through it without finding it too alien. However, this time,
I had decided to give it a week. Since then, I have not come back to
using vim. Working with emacs was a period of rediscovery in text
editing. When I was working with vim, my approach to using it was very
functional and lazy. I would only care to learn about something in vim,
when the choice I had was between learning more about my editor or
spending a couple of hours doing things the mundane way. Emacs however,
is nowhere as humble as vim is! Working with the former, I felt that
there was a lot more that I could get done, if I could only learn how to
use feature X properly. And emacs has a quite a few of such feature Xs.</p>
<p>However despite the apparent promiscuity of emacs, it is a very focused
editor. The coherence of its interface is extremely refreshing. Also, it
makes it very easy to work with complex commands. It infers more about
the text, and its nature when providing its interface, unlike vim, which
does precisely what it is asked to do more often than not. Another
interesting facet of emacs is that it can be used as a complete and
flexible development environment and handle duties as my terminal of
choice, windowing manager, ssh/grep replacement, magit version control,
org mode goodness and a whole lot more.</p>                </article>
